            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And amongſt the manifold wayes &amp; meanes, which Satan hath deviſed and practiſed, to manifeſt his malice againſt God and his Saincts, none hath been more dangerous, nor more availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to further iniquitie and cauſe deſtruction; then the Antichriſtian generation, which under the title of the Church and Spowſe of Chriſt, and Miniſters of the Goſpell, have corrupted the earth and brought the Nations into miſerable bondage and ſlaverie.</p>
            <p>In this 13. chapter is declared the ſtate, policy and proceeding of the Antichriſtian Dominion and Kingdome, as the ſame was ſignified and foreſhewed to Iohn the ſervant of Ieſus Chriſt in a threefold forme.</p>
            <p>Firſt by a beaſt riſing up out of the ſea, having 7. heads &amp; 10. hornes. <hi>verſes</hi> 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly by a beaſt coming up out of the earth, having two hornes like the lambe, but ſpake like the dragon. <hi>verſes</hi> 11. 12. 13. 14.</p>
            <p>Thirdly by an image of the firſt beaſt, which the ſecond beaſt cauſed them that dwelt on the earth to make, as in <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. 15. 16. 17. 18.</p>
            <p>As the Dominion of the Medes Perſians and Grecians (which perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.</note> and deſtroyed the holy people of God the Iewes) were ſignified and foreſhewed to Daniel, in a viſion vnder the formes of ſeverall beaſts, according to the qualities of thoſe dominions; ſo here the Antichriſtian dominion which perſecuted the Churches and people of Chriſt, was foreſhewed to Iohn under the formes of ſuch beaſts as are here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3225:3"/> whereby we may learne that as reaſon and judgment is not to be expected in a beaſt, ſo equitie and right is not to be expected in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, but the contrarie.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe beaſts, Iohn ſayth. <hi>That as I ſtood upon the ſea ſand, I ſaw a Beaſt riſe up out of the ſea having</hi> 7. <hi>heads and</hi> 10. <hi>hornes, and upon his hornes</hi> 10. <hi>Crownes, and upon his heads the names of Blaſphemy. And the Beaſt which I ſaw was like unto a Leopard, and his feet as the feet of a Beare, and his mouth as the mouth of a Lyon, and the Dragon gave him his power, and his ſeate and great authoritie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That by this firſt Beaſt was ſignified and repreſented ſome ſtate of people and body politique, I preſume no reaſonable man exerciſed in the Scriptures will deny, becauſe (as it hath been ſayd) it is there to be ſeene that ſuch States and Dominions as God hath uſed as rodds and ſcourges to chaſtiſe &amp; correct his Church and people withall, have been repreſented by beaſts. States and Dominions they are of two ſorts, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, but of which ſort the State here ment is, there hath been and is great oppoſition. Many underſtand it to be the Romane Empire, to which I cannot conſent, becauſe the Romane Empire is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned of God, and is therefore a lawfull Dominion. But the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here repreſented, is ſayd to be from the Dragon that old Serpent the Divell, who is ſayd to give his power and his throne and great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie unto it, and therefore unlawfull: neither can I conceive it to be any other civil dominion for the ſame reaſon. But to be ſhort I underſtand it to be an Eccleſiaſticall Sate or Dominion, and in particular that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which is called <hi>The Catholike Church repreſentative conſiſting of the Prelacy and Preiſthood of many Nations, as Patriarches Cardinalls Archbiſhops Biſhops, with divers other elected perſons, who being called and gathered into coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells or ſynodes (uſually called generall Counſells) did uſurpe and take on them the office of Chriſt Ieſus in making Lawes and Canons, erecting Courts, inſtituting of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and officers in matters of Religion, (as for the goverment of the Church and for the worſhip of God) to be of all men obſerved &amp; obeyed.</hi> Theſe generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells (or as the Catholicks call it) the catholike Church repreſentative, have challenged and exerciſed ſpirituall authoritie and dominion (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the text) over all kinreds toungs and Nations. By their lawes &amp; canons they have guided and governed them as one vniverſall or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and made them alſo to obſerve their decrees and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements for doctrine. This they have doen both before and alſo ſince the Pope was exalted to his dignitie, as all hiſtories of the Church doe teſtify, So that it hath been and is a great queſtion among the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, whether the authoritie of the Pope, or the Catholick Church in caſes of Religion be the greater. And whereas it is ſayd in the 12. verſ. that the ſecond Beaſt exerciſed all the power of the firſt Beaſt before him, therby is confirmed the trueth of this expoſition. For the ſecond Beaſt being the Pope (as hereafter is ſhewed) hath exerciſed the whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Catholick church or generall counſells, and not of any other State or Dominion.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:3225:3"/>
            <p>Further that this is the firſt beaſt here preſented that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (thorough Gods helpe) ſhall make manifeſt and apparant. But before I doe proceed I deſire the Reader to obſerve that I doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all uſe of Counſells or Synods, but doe hold that diverſe men of divers churches may lawfully be aſſembled together, to conſult and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of matters concerning Religion, and the worſhip of God, for their inſtruction and better information of their Iudgments, and ſo a good &amp; holy uſe may be thereof. But that any counſells have ſuch power over the churches of Chriſt, as to impoſe upon them thrir commaundements for doctrine, and to vſurp the goverment of the Churches, and to rule and reigne over them by their lawes and canons, and preſcribe rules and formes how God wilbe worſhipped, as theſe generall counſells have done, that I doe deny, as being contrary to the perfection of the holy <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 18.</note> Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Apoſtles and Elders of the Church of Ieruſalem, who being aſſembled togither did profeſſe it to be <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10.</note> a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God to lay ſuch a yoke on the diſciples necks, as the obſerving of the Iewiſh ceremonies, which being unlawfull to doe it is much more unlawfull to deviſe and impoſe any other, and therfore the ſaid aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Apoſtles and Elders, concluded to lay no greater burden vpon the diſciples then to abſteyne from ſuch neceſſary things as either were ſimply evill in themſelves, as fornication, or els evill in reſpect of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 18. 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> offence, as meats offred to Idols, blood and things ſtrangled.</p>
            <p>Now to proceed, Firſt it is ſayd of this Beaſt, That he did riſe up out of the ſea. By his riſing up was foreſhewed that the Antichriſtian poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſhould ariſe from a poore and meane eſtate to great riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the world, which we and former generations have ſeene to the vttermoſt fulfilled, For dayes there were when the Churches of Chriſt both Miniſters and people were hated deſpiſed and perſecuted in the world, ſyoyled of their goods, made gazingſtocks and wonders, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with all kinde of crueltie, as hiſtories both ſacred and humane doe abundantly ſpecifie and declare. The Apoſtle Paul ſaith of himſelf &amp; his fellow brethren the Miniſters of the Goſpel, that they were as men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to death: and in the account of the world as the filth, refuſe &amp; ofſcouring of all things. But ſince this beaſtly generation hath ſucceeded the church, and under the titles of Miniſters of the Goſpell, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops over Gods people, have found meanes by little and little to riſe up and to exalt themſelves over the Nations, and to bring the multitudes and peoples, and Nations and Tounges under their Iuriſdiction rule and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reu</hi> 18. 3. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 7.</note> Dominion, and they have ſo riſen up that they are become the great men of the earth, and are waxed rich through the abundance of their delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. This miſtery of iniquitie was working in the Apoſtles tyme, for there were then crept into the church thoſe that deſired worldly pompe and promotion, and were not contented with the portion of the Lordes heritage, but their ambicious deſires could not then be ſatiſfied, there was a lett in the way that hindered it, which lett being removed their purpoſes (ſoone after) tooke effect, fitly therefore is this generation ſaid
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3225:4"/> to riſe up (in reſpect of thoſe whoſe ſucceſſors they, boaſt themſelues to be) The former hold no certaine dwelling places but were expoſed to hunger, thirſt, cold, nakedneſſe, buffetings &amp;c. But theſe latter have their Lordly Houſes, warrelike Caſtles, &amp; Prince like Pallaces, they have their rents, revenues, and abundance of riches, in great exceſſe, they are pompouſly arayed in ſtately robes and rich apparell, they rule like lords over the people, &amp; have power to afflict all that will not beare the yoke of their Dominion, thus is this generation riſen up and exalted as all may ſee that liſt to minde it.</p>
            <p>The place from whence this Beaſt is ſayd to riſe up, <hi>is the ſea.</hi> The Naturall Sea we know is the gathering togither of many waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 9. 10. A like thing muſt that be out of which this Beaſt was to riſe, But in the 17. chapter, <hi>Multitudes, and nations, peoples and Toungs</hi> are reſembled by waters, therfore the gathering together of ſuch into one body politike may rightly be reſembled by the Sea. Thus then the trueth ſtandeth; By the riſing up of this beaſt out of the Sea was foreſhewed, That thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters (that is the people and multitudes and Nations and Toungs, not onely under the Romane Empire, but moſt nations and people of the world) being gathered into one ſea or eccleſiaſticall State, ſhould breed and bring forth this Monſter.</p>
            <p>For they being of two contrary ſorts, the ſeed of the Serpent &amp; the ſeed of the Woman, children of the kingdome, and children of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, vnto the one ſort the word of God (in the adminiſtration therof) is the ſavour of life unto life, unto the other ſort it is the ſavour of death unto death, The one ſort feare God and wil obey him rather then man, The other feare and reverence the arme of fleſh, more then they doe the living God. Theſe (as light and darkneſſe) being contrary one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the one being of Chriſt, the other of Belial: how therfore ſhould they in things concerning God and Chriſt, Faith and Religion, agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? Thoſe which be of God, cannot but witneſſe againſt thoſe that be of the world, becauſe their deeds are evill. Thoſe which are of the world, are heady high minded, proud boaſters, wiſe in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and therfore ſcorne to be rebuked, and hate to be reformed. Theſe being together in the world as Wheate and Tares in one Field; and as Sheep and goates in one Flocke, the true end of the adminiſtration of the word of God had beene to call and ſeparate the one from the other, the precious from the vile, beleevers from inſidells. But notwithſtanding this generation thought it to be wiſedome to take a contrary courſe, namely to bring all people of all ſorts to be one Church, and likewiſe unto vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie in Religion. And becauſe it could not be effected by the power of the Word of God (that ſword of the ſpirit) they procured the helpe of worldly governours to bring it to paſſe by their power and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund. By which deviſe and policie theſe many waters, that is the Nations and people have beene gathered into one Church and eccleaſticall body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike, here repreſented by the Sea, and have been brought to uſe all one order of worſhip, ſervice and government. But this conformitie not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3225:4"/> being procured thorough love, but conſtrayned by feare, was but an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane deviſe and worldly policie, and no divine Inſtitution, And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be upholden, maynteyned and continued by the word of God, and the adminiſtration of a ſerviceable Miniſterie; but by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling power of a Lordly Prelacie, whereupon it was thought meet that Synods or Counſells of the chiefeſt of the Prelates and Clergie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe dominions ſhould be gathered togither to make lawes and canons, which all men ſhould be conſtreyned by penall lawes to obſerve and yeild obedience unto, that ſo peace and vnitie might be preſerved and kept amongſt them. And in ſhort time it came to paſſe, that whatſoever theſe Synods or Counſells did agree upon and ſet downe, (how falſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,) was to be held canonicall, and thoſe that contradicted the ſame, were therfore caſt out and condemned as Heretickes. This was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner &amp; the occaſion of the riſing of this Beaſt out <hi>of this turbulent Sea.</hi> And here by the way obſerve, That * <hi>Every good giving and perfect gift is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>from the father of lightes:</hi> But this beaſt is from the Sea beneath not from above, and therfore not belonging to the kingdome of Chriſt, but an adverſary and enemie thereof.</p>
            <p>Of this Beaſt it is ſayd, that he had 7. <hi>heads,</hi> a thing which is monſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous in nature, And therfore by this was foreſhewed that the dominion repreſented by this Beaſt ſhould be a monſtrous dominion.</p>
            <p>Concerning theſe heads, let this be conſidered, That the whole ſtate or ſocietie of the Antichriſtian Sea, is of two ſorts of people, the one ſort, they call the <hi>Clergie,</hi> the other ſort, the <hi>Layetie.</hi> Of theſe the <hi>Clergie</hi> are as heads and guides to direct and goe before, And the <hi>Layetie</hi> as the body or rather the tayle to follow after. Agayne by the ſame policie, their clergy are ſorted into 7. orders or degrees, namely (to ſpeak in their language) 1. <hi>Ianitores ſeu oſtiarij.</hi> 2. <hi>Lectores,</hi> 3. <hi>Exorciſtae:</hi> 4. <hi>Acolithi,</hi> 5. <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draconi.</hi> 6. <hi>Diaconi,</hi> 7. <hi>ſacerdotes.</hi> Theſe are the 7. orders of the Antichriſtian Clergy. As for Popes, Cardinalls, Patriarchs, Arch Biſhops, Biſhops, Arch deacons &amp;c. they are titles of dignitie, and not of orders. For the Pope is but a Preiſt concerning his orders, and when he ſtands at the Altar and ſayth Maſſe, he doth that as a Preiſt, and not as a Pope, and ſo of all other degrees. This conſidered, it way well be ſaide of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Sinagogue and State, that it is as a Monſter with 7. heads. As for the Miniſters which God hath ordeyned to be in his Church, they are firſt Apoſtles, ſecondly Prophets, thirdly Teachers &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. &amp;c. See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. 7. 8. <hi>&amp; Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. 12. 13. And theſe onely were given for the gathering together of the <hi>Saincts, for the work of the Miniſtery, and for the edification of the body of Chriſt.</hi> Not ſome to have a bunch of keys with a charge of the doores of this or that Temple or Cathedrall Church, Another to have a booke to read to the people things which neither he nor they did underſtand. A third to have a booke of Coniurations or Charmes, with charge to read them or ſay by heart to ſuch as were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted of their witts, or poſſeſſed with divills, and to put their hands vpon them. A fourth to have a Taper or wax candle with a candleſtick
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3225:5"/> to carry before the preiſts and deacons in doeing their ſervice.</p>
            <p>A fift to receive of the people oblations and offrings, and to deliver them to the Deacon to carry to the Altar, To reade the Epiſtle and to ſtand by the Preiſt while he was ſaying the Maſſe.</p>
            <p>A ſixth to be the Biſhops ſpye and intelligencer to informe him of ſuch as be irregular, and obſerve not their orders, To read the Goſpell, attend the preiſt at the Altar &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A ſeventh to conſecrate the Hoaſt as they call it, and then to offer it as a ſacrifice propitiatory for the quick and dead.</p>
            <p>Theſe are not they which God hath given to be in the Church; But theſe are they wherof the Antichriſtian clergy conſiſteth, for whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is one of that clergy, is one of theſe 7. orders, be he Pope Prelate or els whatſoever, and to note and foreſhewe this point of policie, this Beaſt which Iohn ſaw had ſeven heads.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall think this to be a vaine, frivolous, and ſtraunge inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to underſtand by the 7. heads of the beaſt, theſe 7. orders of the Clergie, as thinking thoſe heades to betoken things of greater note and importance: Let ſuch conſider what account and reckoning is made of ſuch perſons as have received the Sacrament of Orders, and holy ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the kingdome of the Beaſt, and they ſhall find the interpretation not impertinent, but very agreable. For a time there was ſince the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this prophecy, * when the meaneſt ſhrimpe that was within theſe holy orders (as they call them) was held to be of that dignitie, that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide Concil. Matiſconen. ſecundum. Canon.</hi> 9. 10.</note> the chiefeſt and worthieſt ſecular Iudge in a kingdome was held vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to judge or cenſure them for any treſpaſſe or fact, how notorious wicked and manifeſt ſoever, becauſe they had received holy Tonſure, &amp; were therby conſecrated and ſet a part unto God, to be his portion and heritage, &amp; to pray for the people, and therfore were exempted from all ſecular juriſdiction and power, ſuch was their dignitie accounted to be, and ſtill is where that kingdome prevayleth and hath the dominion: yea, even in this land that quarrell hath coſt the King his Crowne: as is to be ſeen in the Hiſtoryes of the Reigne of King Iohn, and not his Crowne onely, but his life alſo. Now if the meaneſt of them be above the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of any King or ſecular Iudge, and ſecular Iudges be the heads of the people, whome God hath appointed to beare rule over them, well may theſe be ſaid to be as heads in the kingdome of the Beaſt, wherin theſe ſhavelings are holden to be ſo holy and high in dignitie and degree.</p>
            <p>As this Beaſt which Iohn ſaw had 7. <hi>heads,</hi> ſo likewiſe it <hi>had</hi> 10. <hi>hornes,</hi> whereby was foreſhewed that as the kings of the Medes and Perſians were ſhewed and repreſented to Daniel, by the 2. hornes of the Beaſt which he ſaw in his viſion, ſo the kings of many kingdomes ſhould be as guarders and defenders of the Antichriſtian kingdome and ſtate. And that this ſcripture hath beene fulfilled to the vttermoſt by the kings of the Nations, is ſo manifeſt, that none can be ignorant of it, that are of judgment and experience. And it was juſt with the Lord to make the Kings of the earth vaſſels to this Beaſt, becauſe they received not the love
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3225:5"/> of the truth, but tooke pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe; they would not forſake their ſinnes to liue godlily, righteouſly, and ſoberly (as all muſt doe that will attaine ſalvation) but they would liue after their luſts, and for their ſinnes they would make ſatisfaction by building of Churches and Monaſteries, &amp;c. and endowing them with lands, rents, and other revenewes, by meanes whereof thoſe which traded like Marchants in thoſe many waters, the kingdome of the Beaſt grew rich and wealthy, and became the great men of the earth.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith of the Beaſt, which hee ſaw that it was like a <hi>Leopard,</hi> &amp;c. By the reſemblance and likeneſſe of a Leopard was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that this Beaſt ſhould be foule and full of ſpots, as is ſhewed in the 18. Chapter: <hi>Babylon is become the habitation of Diuels, and the hold of fowle ſpirits, and the cage of every vncleane and hatefull Bird.</hi> The filthineſſe of this Beaſt is apparant, in that he doth by force and Armes compell all ſorts of wicked and ungodly people to be of his ſocietie, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth none but the godly, therefore fitly was he thus prefigured.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by the qualitie and diſpoſition of the Leopard was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that this generation ſhould bee ſubtill and craftie in getting their prey. They boaſt themſelues to bee the Church and Spouſe of Chriſt; but if it be ſo, whence then had they that infinite ſtore and aboundance of worldly wealth and riches wherewith they exceed in deliciouſneſſe of liuing? This was not the condition of Chriſt and his Diſciples, the Lord himſelfe had not whereon to lay his head, but in that reſpect was more deſtitute then Foxes which haue holes, and then Birds which haue neſts: his Diſciples wanted gold and ſilver, and had no certaine dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place; whence therefore had this generation their lands, liuings, and Lordſhips? Their Caſtles, Mannors, Houſes and Princely Palaces? It will bee ſaid of the donation and gift of Emperours, Kings, and other great States, and of the charitable deuotion of all ſorts of people: But how were people brought to bee ſo full handed to this generation? To bring this about much ſlight, craft and nimbleneſſe of wit was vſed; firſt, people were made to beleeue, that what they gaue to the Church was to the maintenance of the Miniſterie of the Goſpell, and for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and reliefe of the poore, and therefore ſhould be a ſacrifice ſo well pleaſing to God, and meritorious, as that it ſhould receiue great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at his hands, herewith the mindes of religious and devout people were ſo much moued, that they thought nothing too much to giue to the Church, by meanes whereof Churches began to grow rich. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, people were made to beleeue that the worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and relickes of Saints, and building of Churches, Chappels, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, &amp;c. and endowing them with Lands, Tenements, Parſonage and Vicarage houſes, &amp;c. was an effectuall way to haue favour with the Saints, and to procure their prayers and interceſſion for them: By theſe, and ſuch like meanes this wylie and crafty generation deluded the people, and made themſelues rich, and robbed Chriſt of his honour, who onely is our Advocate to God. And furthermore, they gathered in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3225:6"/> heapes of wealth, by Maſſes, Pilgrimages, Purſſe-pennance, Offerings, and ſuch like Marchandiſes, wherein their ſubtilty and craft was prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by a Leopard; a beaſt ſubtill by nature, whoſe propertie is to lie in waite for her prey, and ſlylie to catch it as the Cat doth the Mouſe, and in that reſpect doth well reſemble the Antichriſtian Clergie, that ſubtill generation.</p>
            <p>But further it is added, that <hi>the feete of this Beaſt were as the feete of a Beare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Leopard is more nimble to catch then the Beare, but the Beare is more ſtrong and eager to hold faſt that which hee hath ſeaſed vpon, then is the Leopard: both theſe properties this generation hath; nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to catch, and greedy to hold: they catch by ſlight, but hold by force, and therefore in catching reſemble the Leopard, but in faſt hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the feete of a Beare.</p>
            <p>To this it is added, that <hi>the mouth of this Beaſt was as the mouth of a Lyon:</hi> And by this another property of the Antichriſtian Clergie was foreſhewed: for as the Lyon when hee hath taken his prey roareth upon it, at whoſe roaring the beaſts tremble: So this Generation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus exalted and made rich, and hauing gotten their prey, they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the ſmall Beaſts of their Forreſt, roaring with curſes and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications againſt any, be he Prince or Peſant, that ſhall preſume to part ſtakes with them, or meddle with their prey, or diminiſh their portion but an Egge or an Onion. That theſe be the properties of this Generation needs no proofe, it is manifeſt by daily experience.</p>
            <p>Here therefore wee may learne what to eſteeme and iudge of the Antichriſtian Clergie, together with thoſe Multitudes, People, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tongues, out of which they haue ſprung, and over which they are ſet and ſupported; namely, that they are a monſtrous and beaſtly generation, excelling in craft, covetouſneſſe, pride, crueltie, and all iniquity; and therefore not to be eſteemed, as they boaſt themſelues to be a holy Catholick Church, and Spouſe of Chriſt which cannot erre, &amp;c. And by this wee may ſee how lamentably the Nations haue beene deluded and led into errour and vngodlineſſe by their Guides and Leaders.</p>
            <p>Now it followeth, that unto this Monſter the <hi>Dragon</hi> gaue his power, and his Throne, and <hi>great authoritie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is declared of whom the Prelates and Clergie haue received their ſpirituall Lordſhips, power, authoritie and iuriſdiction, to deviſe and make ſpirituall Lawes and Canons, to erect ſpirituall Courts, and create Officers to beare rule and exerciſe dominion over the Nations, euen from the diuell: they haue not any lawfull authoritie from God, but an vſurped authority from the diuell, whoſe inſtruments they are to advance his kingdome, and to perſecute the Saints, which obey God rather then men.</p>
            <p>And here wee may obſerue that they are rightly called ſpirituall Lords, becauſe originally they proceed from that Prince that ruleth in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3225:6"/> the aire, the ſpirit that worketh in the children of vnbeleefe: but withall, in ſtead of ſpirituall Lords, Lawes, Courts and Officers, call them ſpirituall wickedneſſes, and ſo wee giue them their right title: and being ſuch, if we will fight the good fight of faith, wee muſt by witneſſing what they bee, wraſtle againſt them, and not ſubmit vnto them, but ſtand faſt in that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made vs free, and not be intangled with any yoke of bondage: and that we may wraſtle and prevaile, we muſt take vnto vs the whole Armour of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Further <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that he <hi>ſaw one of the heads of the Beaſt as it were</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>wounded to death, and his deadly wound was healed, and all the world won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered after the Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Head, which was as it were wounded to death, was ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reviving of Prieſthood, the myſterie whereof, in few words, is this. <q rend="inline">The workers of iniquitie in this Antichriſtian Kingdome, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ordained this order of miniſtery called Prieſthood (whether it were in imitation of the Iewes or Heathen it is doubtfull) but certaine it is, that becauſe it wanted externall ſacrifices, it came ſhort both of the Iewiſh Prieſthood, and alſo of the Heathen, ſo that it was a lame and wounded Prieſthood, and was not reſpected.</q> In time it came to paſſe that they found out a ſacrifice (as is to bee ſeene in their Maſſe-booke) which was the tranſubſtantiating of bread and wine, into the very Bodie and Bloud of Chriſt, really and ſubſtantially (as they vſe to ſpeake and teach) and being ſo tranſubſtantiated to offer it vp vnto God a ſacrifice propitiatorie both for quick and dead. Thus the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded head of Prieſthood was cured and revived, and ſo became the worlds wonder, as now it followeth to bee declared, according as <hi>Iohn</hi> here witneſſeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And all the world wondred after the Beaſt.</hi> That is, The people of the Nations hauing this Prieſthood ſet over them, and commended unto them to bee of ſuch power and dignitie, as that they could make them a viſible God, not onely to behold with their eyes, and looke vpon, but alſo to eate, and that their maker and redeemer to their everlaſting ſalvation: And being ſo effectually deluded as that they beleeued theſe lyes, hereupon they wondred and followed the Beaſt. Well might they wonder to ſee bread, and taſte bread, where was no bread, and to ſee wine, and taſte wine, where was no wine (for ſo were they made to beleeue) and to eate fleſh, and drinke bloud, and yet neither to ſee nor taſte fleſh nor bloud: this was a wonder to wonder at; and who would not follow him for a guide that had power to worke ſuch wonders?</p>
            <p>But they did not onely follow the Beaſt, as the Iewes did Chriſt when they ſaw his miracles, <hi>But they worſhipped the Dragon which gaue</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>power vnto the Beaſt, and they worſhipped the Beaſt, ſaying who is like vnto the Beaſt? Who is able to make warre with him?</hi> To worſhip, is to heare and obey, and by worſhipping the Dragon was ſhewed, that they wholly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3225:7"/> addicted themſelues to be directed and ruled by the Beaſt whom the Dragon uſed as his inſtrument to worke his will, and to whom he had giuen authority and power to that end: thus orginally they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the divell. Secondly, they worſhiped the Beaſt, as being the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the divell, and they became ſubiects in all things obedient unto the Beaſt, as being of ſuch holineſſe and truth as that it could not erre, nor deceiue others, and of ſuch power as what they looſed on earth was looſed in heaven, and what they bound in earth was bound in heaven, &amp; therfore ſuch a power as had no match or peere, ſo that they boaſted, and ſaid of it, <hi>Who is like unto the Beaſt?</hi> As <hi>David</hi> conſidering the power, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 77.</note> and wonderfull works of God, ſaith; <hi>Who is like unto the Lord?</hi> So doe the Nations boaſt of this Beaſt, ſaying; <hi>Who is like unto the Beaſt?</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſayd of him, <hi>Who is able to make warre with him?</hi> As if they ſhould ſay, This our holy Mother hath power to excommunicate, and deliver to Satan, all (of what eſtate condition, and degree, ſoever they be) that will not heare her voyce, beare her yoke, and be ruled by her: Who therefore is able to make warre with her? that is, make his party good againſt this our holy Mother. Of ſuch admiration was this Beaſt in the earth; thus hath the world thought, and ſpoken of her.</p>
            <p>And moreover, there was <hi>given unto this Beaſt a mouth ſpeaking great things and blaſphemies, and power was given him to make</hi> 42. <hi>moneths.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As the mouth is the meanes and inſtrument whereby men do declare their mindes, ſo this Beaſt had a mouth to declare and utter her minde; by which mouth was ſignified a Miniſterie of falſe Prophets, and lying Spirits, namely, Doctors, Schoole-men, Monkes, Frvars, and all ſorts of their Preachers, who teach for doctrines the commandements of the Beaſt, and declare and utter the minde and will of the Beaſt as being equall to Gods Word, this their Canons, Lawes, Books and Monuments, do manifeſtly witneſſe: The effect of that which this mouth uttereth is noted to be, <hi>great things, and blaſphemies.</hi> They boaſt of this Beaſt that ſhe is the holy Catholick Church Militant, the Mother of all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, the chaſte Spouſe of Chriſt, the Pillar and ground of Truth, that it cannot erre, &amp;c. And that all which will haue God to be their Father, muſt haue her to be their Mother; Finally, that out of her lap and communion there is no ſaluation. Theſe, and many other ſuch great things ſpeaketh the mouth of this Beaſt, which are indeed great things, and being ſo ſpoken are great blaſphemies: For is it not great blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to call that Holy, which is moſt abominable? To call her the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all true Beleevers, which is the Mother of fornications, and of all abominations? To call that the Pillar and ground of Truth, which hath corrupted the earth with her errours and fornications and cauſed all Nations to drinke of the wine of the wrath thereof? To ſay there is no ſaluation but in her followſhip whoſe end and iudgement is to go to deſtruction? Beware of falſe Prophets, and teachers of lyes, for ſuch are the mouth of this Beaſt.</p>
            <p>And it is further to be minded, that it is ſaid of this Beaſt, that the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3225:7"/> mouth which ſhe had was given her; for had this Beaſt no more to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this mouth, then ſhe hath of her own by diſcent and heritage, ſhe could not haue ſo many to ſpeake for her as ſhe hath: But Emperors and Kings, Princes &amp; Nobles, and other great ſinners became benefactors to this Beaſt, giving unto her Lands and Tenements, rents &amp; revenewes to maintaine this mouth to utter great things and blaſphemies, and more then this, <hi>Power was given him to act, or make two and fortie moneths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of this point, let this be conſidered: In the Antichriſtian Kingdome they haue a rule how to proceed in every cauſe, but not given them of God, but of their own making, which they commonly call the Canon Law, concerning vvhich Law here we may learne by vvhom it vvas made, &amp; how long it was in making. Theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers uſurp the name of the Church of Chriſt, but the true Church is the Kingdom of Chriſt, and being the Kingdom of Chriſt it hath him onely for lawgiver, they therefore which under the title of the Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to make lawes, are fitly &amp; worthily reſembled by a Beaſt: For what is more unreaſonable then for thoſe whoſe greateſt dignity, glory &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, conſiſteth in hearing, obeying, &amp; adminiſtring of Gods Word, to fall from this, and Lucifer-like to exalt &amp; oppoſe themſelues againſt their Maker, as though they were vviſer &amp; iuſter then God; &amp; to adde unto his Teſtament vvhich is ſufficient to inſtruct us in all vviſedome, &amp; to make the man of God perfect in every good work; and to take from the ſame <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17.</note> Teſtament at their pleaſure, vvhich is not lawfull to do to any mans teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vvithout great offence and injuſtice, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 15. yet this is the way wherein thoſe great doers, the authors of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law haue vvalked. It is ſaid of thoſe Actors, <hi>that Power was given them, &amp;c.</hi> Where firſt vve may obſerue, that of themſelues they had not this power, for then it could not haue been ſaid to be given them, but given them it was; it is therefore to be conſidered vvho vvas the giver. Not Chriſt, hee gaue his Diſciples no power to make lawes, but gaue them charge to teach beleevers to obſerue all things vvhatſoever he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, it is certain therfore that this power vvas given them, not by God but by men; namely, by Kings &amp; Princes, for the ſtates &amp; degrees of men conſidered, it is plaine, that none can giue power to make lawes but ſuch as be Soveraignes; by ſuch therefore this power to make lawes vvas given unto this Beaſt. But vvhat ſhould moue Soveraignes to giue power to Biſhops &amp; Miniſters to make lawes for the Church? Nothing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily but blind devotion; for they being ignorant of God, &amp; of his Word, thought it the beſt vvay to keep peace &amp; unity in the Church, vvheras in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it vvas the cauſe of ſtrife &amp; diſſention, &amp; at length by that meanes iniquity vvas eſtabliſhed for a law, &amp; Gods Word vvholly reiected &amp; caſt aſide as unmeet for Lay-men to uſe. Now as in all lavvfull proceedings, Princes are Gods miniſters, in Gods ſtead unto their ſubiects and people, ſo in giving this povver to this Beaſt, they are the Dragons miniſters, and inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Wheras it is ſaid that power was give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto the Beaſt to make, but it is not noted what ſhould be made, it argueth that the things made
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3225:8"/> are of that nature and qualitie that they are not worthy of any name, the makers themſelues uſe to call their Acts, Canons, Conſtitutions and Lawes, but falſly; for if they were ſuch indeed, then men might haue ſome good uſe of them, but that no man can haue, therefore it is but falſhood and deceit ſo to name them: It is like the calling of one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Image, S. <hi>Peter,</hi> another S. <hi>Paul,</hi> another S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp;c. that is to name things that which they be not, and that is to lie.</p>
            <p>In that it is ſayd, that power was given unto the Beaſt to make 42. Monethes, It ſheweth that the beaſts time is limited. And ſeing that the time is limited, we muſt finde that the time of making of the Catholick church agreeth with this ſtint, before we can be ſure that it is the Beaſt, here repreſented, wherefore conſider that the eccleſiaſticall ſtate began to make about the yere of our <hi>Lord,</hi> 304. (the Ancyran counſell being the firſt, whoſe conſtitutions took the effect and force of lawe,) And made not an end of making untill the yere 1564. the Counſell of Trent being the laſt wherin the beaſt acted the laſt act of this making, and fulfilled the meaſure of that iniquitie, and therfore is now to receive judgment and condemnation from the Lord, as is hereafter in this propheſie declared. So that if we account a yeare for a day, and thirtie dayes for a moneth, it will amount to 1260. dayes, which is the juſt ſome of 42. moneths, that this beaſt was a making, which is a ſtrong argument, that by this beaſt was ſignified the eccleſiaſticall eſtate, or Catholick church, as is ſhewed before page 1.</p>
            <p>Further it is ſayd of this Beaſt, that he opened <hi>his mouth in blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his name, and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that this Beaſt, by the miniſterie of falſe Prophets and Teachers, as by her mouth hath ſeduced the Nations, and made them beleeve, That God by the Miniſterie of his holy Apoſtles and Prophets, hath not left us a ſure and ſufficient rule of faith, in the holy Scriptures, but that the want therof muſt be ſupplied with unwritten verities, the writings of auncient fathers, determinations of counſells, and the Popes decretals, otherweiſe all people would runne into confuſion, it may truely be ſayd, that ſhe hath opened her mouth unto blaſphemie againſt God. Firſt it maketh the eternall who hath created all things, and for whoſe wills ſake all things are and were created, To be but a rude and groſſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a work, which he hath left and given up for vayne man to finiſh &amp; make perfect. Secondly if there be particular lawes left out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for want of which all people would runne into confuſion, then God hath not ſhewed himſelf to be a God of order. Thirdly the word of God is not ſufficient to make the man of God perfect, in every good worke, as the Apoſtles ſayth. But thus to think, is a horrible errour, Thus to ſpeake, is wicked blaſphemy, and thus to teach, is helliſh iniquitie. For how wil it ſtand with the glory of God, and of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, not to give unto his people a perfect Law and ſure Teſtimonie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they might truſt, and wherin they might reſt and live by faith, but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3225:8"/> muſt depend upon other men, to ſee as it were with their eyes, and not with their owne, and ſo to hold their faith in reſpect of other mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to beleeve as they beleeve &amp;c, as though Gods people (their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders excepted) were not reaſonable creatures, but as beaſts without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: But bleſſed be our God, wee have a ſure word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which is as a light ſhining in a dark place, wherunto we ſhall do well if wee take heed. Gods people haue no need of unwritten verities, mens precepts and traditions; They have ſurer lights to walk by then the writings of the Schoole men, and other writers of auntient times; They haue ſurer Rules and righter Teſtimonies, wherby to decide and end controverſies and doubts, then the determinations of counſells, and Popes decrees, and they which ſpeake to the contrary, open their mouth to blaſpheme againſt God. Concerning blaſpheming the name of God, amongſt other attributes or titles whereby he is ſett forth unto us, he is called the <hi>Holy one of Iſrael,</hi> and the high Prieſt in Iſrael did beare this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription upon his forehead graven in gold, <hi>Holyneſſe to the Lord.</hi> Firſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may truely and boldly ſay of the Lord, that <hi>Holy</hi> is his name, Secondly we may likewiſe truely and boldly affirme, that to give the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Holyneſſe</hi> unto any unholy prophane and abhominable thing, is to blaſpheme the name of God: But thus the Beaſt hath done many and ſundrie wayes. They aſcribe <hi>Holynes</hi> unto their Antichriſtian orders, and preiſthood, to their Idolatrous Maſſe, to their exorciſed or conjured Bread, Water, Oyle, Tapers, Aſhes, Veſtures, Veſſells, and many other implements in and by all which they blaſpheme the name of God.</p>
            <p>And as they blaſpheme the name of God; So likewiſe they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his Tabernacle, That is to ſay, the true viſible Church of Chriſt vnder the Goſpel, which is the place of Gods preſence, which he hath choſen to put his name there, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 18.</note> where two or three or more are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together in the name of Chriſt, there is Chriſt preſent, and where Chriſt is preſent there hath God put his name, there he is to be ſought; and there hee may bee found, and there is his Tabernacle. To come together in the name of Chriſt, is when Gods people ioyne themſelues together in a ſpirituall body politicke, ſeparated from the common multitudes of knowne unbeleevers, to the end to meete together for the mutuall edification and comfort one of another, by doctrine, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread and prayer, and to practiſe all other Ordinances of Chriſt ſet downe in his Teſtament, as they ſhall haue occaſion: and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Beleeuers, hauing ſuch fellowſhip and communion one with another, the title of the Churches of Chriſt doth (in our uſe of ſpeech) properly and of right belong: but for beleevers to doe this apart by themſelues is adiudged contempt of authority, factious, novelty, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Conventicles and unlawfull Aſſemblies, dangerous to the State, and not to be ſuffered in any Kingdome or Common-wealth, and ſo they blaſpheme the Tabernacle of God in a high degree, as if Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were a company of ungodly rebels, and wicked conſpirators; but the righteous Lord will in due time viſit his people, &amp; rebuke his enemies.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:3225:9"/>
            <p>And on the other ſide, for Gods people now to deny the kingdome of the Beaſt; that is, (as they call it) the holy Catholick church Militant, to be the true Church of Chriſt: To refuſe to partake and communicate with them in their abominations, deluſions, and unfruitfull workes of darkneſſe, is adjudged diſobedience, ſchiſme and contempt of the power and authoritie of the Church: To ſpeak againſt their proceedings, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſturbance of the peace of the Church, hereſie, impietie, and what not? Thus they adorne the Harlott, which corrupteth the earth with her fornications, with the title of the Church, and ſpouſe of Chriſt, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of God, And ſo blaſpheme the Tabernacle of God, as if it were not a communion of Saincts by calling and profeſſion, but an habitation of Divells, an hold of Fowle ſpirits, and a cage of every uncleane &amp; hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bird.</p>
            <p>Further it is ſayd of the Beaſt, that it did <hi>blaſpheme thoſe that dwelt in heaven,</hi> that is the <hi>Saincts</hi> departed this life.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that dwell in heaven, are then blaſphemed when it is ſayd of them, that they take it as honour done unto them, when we make them our Patrones, build them Temples, ſet up their images, offer and pray unto them, and make them Mediators between Chriſt and us, for by this they are made not onely idolls, but alſo favorers and cheife maynteyners of idolatrie: They are alſo blaſphemed when the doctrine which they taught and practiſed is condemned for hereſie, or when erronious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, vayne traditions, ſuperſtitious rites, ceremonies and cuſtomes are fathered upon them as received from them by Tradition, as unwritten verities, but the world hath been brought to beleeue that Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven might by theſe meanes bee as it were bought and fold, betweene Prieſt and people, wherein they haue been highly blaſphemed.</p>
            <p>Moreover it is ſaid, that it <hi>was given to the Beaſt to make warre with the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>Saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all Kindreds, and Tongues and Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Warre is made with the Saints when they are accuſed to Rulers and Governours to be Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, wicked and ungodly perſons; and they may then be ſaid to bee overcome, when their accuſers are iuſtified and they condemned, according to this, this Scripture hath been fulfilled and verified. Great and of long continuance haue been the warres which the Beaſt hath made with the Saints, and many haue been the victories of this kinde which the Beaſt hath had againſt them: as the Hiſtories, and other records of the Nations do plentifully wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It was given to the Beaſt to make warre with the Saints, when Rulers and Governours gaue way to the Beaſt to deviſe and make lawes at their own pleaſure, concerning Religion and the worſhip of God, and then to condemne for delinquents and euill doers all that would not obſerue thoſe lawes. How free and forward Rulers and Governours haue been to giue ſuch power unto the Beaſt, they themſelues haue felt by long and wofull experience: for much woe hath the Beaſt wrought (not to the poore and meaner ſort of the Saints onely, but)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3225:9"/> even to Emperours and Kings and all degrees of people, and therefore it is ſaid in the words following, that power was given unto this Beaſt over every Kindred, Tongue and Nation: So that the exaltation thereof was ſuch, as to be as a father aboue all fathers to every Kindred; a Lord aboue all Lords to every Tongue; a King aboue all Kings to every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus was this Beaſt exalted, and ſate as a Queene triumphing over them, having all of all degrees brought in bondage unto her dominion, which was a juſt recompence upon their heads that gaue ſuch power unto this Beaſt: yet ſee how the world was herein deluded, they were not as captiues againſt their wills, but in blinde devotion, had this Beaſt in moſt high reverence, as being a Divine Power, ordained and given by God, and not from the Dragon. Thus did the Lord giue them over to bee deluded by this Beaſt, as a iuſt reward of their ungodlineſſe, in that they received not the loue of the truth, but tooke pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Further it is declared in the words following, <hi>That all that dwelt upon</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 8.</note> 
               <hi>the earth ſhall worſhip him</hi> (that is the Beaſt) <hi>whoſe names are not written in the Booke of the life of the Lamb ſlayne from the foundation of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By thoſe that dwell on the earth is meant thoſe that haue ſet their habitation there, and chooſe rather to enioy the proſperitie of the world and the pleaſures of ſinne, together with the Beaſt, then to ſuffer afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the truth, and for witneſſing againſt the Beaſt: Theſe are they that worſhip him, that is, receiue their precepts and rules, for doctrine and wholeſome inſtruction, and obſerue their ordinances and lawes as perfect rules of equitie and righteouſneſſe, caſting the Word of God, declared in the holy Scriptures, behind their backes, and treading his Ordinances under their feete, making farre more conſcience not to eate an Egge on a Friday, then to ſteale, or commit adulterie. But of ſuch it is ſaid, that their names are not written in the Booke of life of the Lamb which was ſlaine from the beginning of the world: That is, they are not of the number of Gods Elect and Choſen in Chriſt, and given unto him for his portion and heritage, whoſe condition is to be hated, deſpiſed, perſecuted, and afflicted in the world, for righteouſnes ſake; in whom the Lamb Chriſt Ieſus, as in his members hath been ſlaine ſince the beginning of the world: which condition, thoſe which cannot brooke and indure, but count it a pleaſure to liue deliciouſly for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and take delight to inioy the pleaſures of ſinne, may thereby bee diſcerned, not to haue their names written in the Book of Life.</p>
            <p>Concerning theſe things it is added, <hi>If any man haue an eare let him heare.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As if it ſhould be ſaid, few there bee which haue an eare to heare theſe things: For who can indure to heare that Catholike Church, which they account to bee ſpirituall, holy, and heavenly, to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Beaſt, ugly in forme, and horrible and monſtrous in nature? Who can indure to heare that Power, that Throne, and that authority which they beleeue to be of God, to be ſaid and affirmed to bee of the Dragon that old Serpent the Diuell and Satan? Who will beleeue that a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3225:10"/> righteous God would giue way to his enemies, the workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſo farre to prevaile, and ſo long time, as for many hundred yeeres together, to delude the Nations, to bring them into bondage, and to keepe them in ſlaverie? And that a few poore deſpiſed people of no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning in the world, here one, and there another, ſhould ſee more, and be wiſer then all the great Clarks, wiſe Counſellours, mightie Princes, and all the Nobles of the earth? Who (I ſay) hath an eare to heare theſe things, and not bee moved to fret in himſelfe, and to gnaſh his teeth at the hearing of them?</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding all this, and more, let him that hath an eare heare, for times and ſeaſons will change; a time will come (as the verſe following doth declare) when theſe great workers of iniquity ſhall bee ſubdued and troden under foote.</p>

            <p>Thus much concerning the firſt part of this Chapter, and of that power and promotion which the Prelates and Clergie crope up unto before the exaltation and ſupremacie of the Pope. The myſterie of whoſe iniquitie is next to be conſidered; <hi>To God be glorie for ever. Amen.</hi>

               <p>AS in the former part of this Chapter, the Prelacie and Clergie in generall, who under the title of the Catholike Church Militant,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3225:10"/> exalted themſelues to work iniquitie, and bring the Nations into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie and bondage to their traditions, were reſembled by a ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Beaſt: ſo here, after much ſtriving amongſt themſelues who ſhould be the chiefe and greateſt, not being content with their former riches, honour, and earthly promotion, but aſpiring higher, at laſt the Prelate of Rome in particular, attained to this title and dignitie, to be Chriſts Vicar, Peters ſucceſſor, and univerſall Biſhop; and under that Title pretended a fulneſſe of power and ſupremacie over all perſons and cauſes, and therefore is here reſembled and fore-ſhewed by a Beaſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Firſt, whereas it is ſaid of this Beaſt that it came up out of the earth, thereby is ſignified, that the high degree and dignitie whereunto the Prelates of Rome haue aſpired, and exalted themſelues, is not from heaven, it is of the earth, earthly; it is a plant which our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath not planted, and therefore ſhall in the end be rooted out.</p>
               <p>Concerning the comming up of this Beaſt, it is to be minded, that the Miniſters of the word of God (of which ranke of men this Beaſt boaſteth himſelfe to be the cheife) if they were in their right kinde ſhould be as the Starres of heaven, lights and guides unto others: But at the opening of the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 13.</note> ſixth Seale <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw the Starres fall from heaven to the earth, as a fig tree caſteth her greene figges when ſhe is ſhaken of a mighty winde; whereby was ſignified, that the Miniſters of the word of God would in time degenerate and goe out of kinde; they would, contrary to the Apoſtles rule, ſet their affections on earthly things, they would for filthy lucre make Marchandize of the people and Word of God; they would gather riches, and grow wealthy by the wages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, and ſo become the great men of the earth: all which is fulfilled and come to paſſe, as all may ſee that are not wilfully blinde.</p>
               <p>Among the reſt of the fallen Starres, to one was given the key of the bottomleſſe pit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 1. whereby was ſignified that power and preheminence ſhould be given to one of the fallen Starres aboue the reſt: which thing was effected and came to paſſe, when <hi>Phocas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Emperour he promoted <hi>Boniface</hi> then Prelate of Rome to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Biſhop, and to haue power and juriſdiction over all other Biſhops: Which thing vvhen <hi>Phocas</hi> had done, this <hi>Abaddon</hi> King of Locuſts, with the reſt of the brood of the bottomeleſſe pit that ſucceeded him, who had the opening and ſhutting of Purgatory at their pleaſure, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in time, that they exalted themſelues aboue Emperours and Kings; which thing they could never haue done, had they not firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted the Nations in blinde devotion to impoveriſh themſelues to feed theſe Locuſts under the title of the Church, and in hope of meriting thereby, and to be releaſed from their ſinnes, and from the ſuppoſed paines of Purgatory: For had the Pope, that Prelate of Rome, been as deſtitute of worldly wealth, and as well furniſhed with ſpirituall grace, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were when they went up into the Temple to pray, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 1. 6.</note> and healed the lame man, he had never ſet his foote upon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours neck. For as much therefore as the Romiſh Prelate from a meane
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3225:11"/> and lowly eſtate and degree in the world, hath crept up and been exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue Kings and Emperours: and ſeeing worldly wealth and riches haue been the meanes whereby he hath got the preheminence, very ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly was this upſtart reſembled and prefigured, by a Beaſt comming up out of the earth.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is ſaid of this Beaſt, that it had two Hornes like the Lamb: By Hornes in the Scripture is uſually ſignified power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and by the Lamb is meant Chriſt Ieſus, who had all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth given to him, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 18. So that hereby was ſhewed, that the Prelate of Rome would challenge and uſurpe great power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which he perſwadeth the world doth belong unto him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts Vicar, and under this pretence uſurpeth a two-fold power and juriſdiction, both Civill and Eccleſiaſticall, not in earth onely, but in heaven alſo; what he bindeth in earth, is bound in heaven, and whom he will he can releaſe from the paines of Purgatorie, and place them in heaven: Therefore in token of this his power he is armed with two ſwords, which thing was plainely ſignified by the two Hornes which he had like the Lamb. But though the Beaſt would be the Lambs equall, and reſemble him in power, yet his voyce bewrayes him to bee but a counterfeit, and a diſſembling hypocrite: he <hi>ſpeakes like the Dragon,</hi> he pretendeth property to that which is not his own, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himſelfe againſt thoſe unto whom he ſhould ſubmit and giue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Even as the Dragon ſaid of the Kingdomes of the world; <hi>All theſe are in my power, I giue them to whom I will?</hi> So likewiſe ſaith this <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 6.</note> Beaſt his Vicar, the Prelate of Rome: The Empire and Kingdomes of the earth are in my power, and at my diſpoſition, and to me it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to depoſe and ſet up Emperours and Kings at my pleaſure, as ſhall bee behoofull for the peace of the Church. And thus may the Beaſt in this bee knowne by his voyce, likewiſe in divers other particular blaſphemous ſpeeches and diveliſh doctrines.</p>
               <p>Further it is ſaid of this Beaſt, That <hi>he exerciſeth all the power of the firſt Beaſt before him, and cauſeth the earth, and them which dwell therein, to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>worſhip the firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that this Beaſt is ſaid to exerciſe, <hi>All the power of the firſt Beaſt before him,</hi> thereby was ſignified, That what the firſt Beaſt could doe by her motherly authority and power under the uſurped title and name of the holy Church, the ſame could this Beaſt doe, by the authority &amp; power of his fatherhood under the title &amp; pretence of Chriſts Vicar, <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, univerſall Biſhop, &amp;c. But that this Beaſt may yet further be diſcerned, it is ſaid of him, That <hi>he cauſed the earth, and thoſe which dwell therein to worſhip the firſt Beaſt, &amp;c.</hi> By cauſing the earth to worſhip the firſt Beaſt, was foreſhewed, that the Pope would exact of the earth the tenth part of the fruits therof for the maintenance of the holy Church, &amp; this is indeed to worſhip: For as the paying of Tithes in the time of the Law was a part of the true outward worſhip of God, ſo this is the worſhip of the Beaſt. And further, by cauſing the Inhabitants of the earth alſo to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3225:11"/> worſhip the firſt Beaſt, was ſhewed that he would carefully ſee due homage, ſervice, and obedience to be yeelded and performed to the holy Church: ſo that though the Prelate of Rome as a ſonne of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did exalt himſelfe aboue meaſure, yet ſtill doth he maintaine the power and dignity of the Catholick Church; the eſtimation of her Motherhood muſt ſtill bee maintained, her voyce muſt ſtill be heard and obeyed; not to come when ſhe calls is contumacie and contempt not to be indured; they that dare ſo farre to deſpiſe her authoritie, as not to obey her Paritors Proceſſe, are by her doome to bee accounted cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed children, and worthy of no leſſe cenſure and puniſhment then to be ſtruck with that terrible Thunderbolt of her Excommunication, the violence whereof is ſuch, as who can indure it? Who will not rather ride, runne, dance attendance, crouch, kneele, pay, pray, or doe any thing elſe which Maiſter Officiall or his Regiſter wil enioyne them, then undergoe ſo heavy a burthen as the cenſure of Excommunication? Thus will the Pope haue the magnificence of this <hi>Diana</hi> to bee maintained, The earth and thoſe which dwell in it muſt yeeld unto her the Tithe of all their increaſe, as alſo Mortuaryes, Offerings, and many other Church duties which ſhe requireth of them; for ſhe is a goddeſſe and muſt bee worſhipped. And this diminiſheth the Popes glorie never a jot, the two eſtates of the Whoore and falſe Prophet, can well agree and ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as father and mother in one family, and therefore the ſecond Beaſt, as father of all, wil haue the firſt Beaſt worſhiped, that is, obeyed &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in glorie, as mother of all. And further obſerue, in that the Pope hath executed all authoritie of the Catholike Church, thereby is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the truth of the expoſition, that the firſt Beaſt was the Catholike Church, and the ſecond Beaſt the Pope, as hath beene before obſerved.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3225:12"/> this Beaſt, as to hold his ſtirrop, to leade his horſe by the bridle, to kiſſe his feete, they thought it no abaſement, but an honour: And notwithſtanding that very many of that beaſtly ranke haue been noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious wicked men, and abominable livers, yet haue they the craft ſo to delude and beſot all people of all degrees in the world, as to bring them to beleeue that the truth is ſo infallibly annexed to that ſeate of the Beaſt, that it is not poſſible for him to erre in iudgement; yea, he made the world to beleeue it as an Article of faith, that his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and iudgement of any controverſie or point of doctrine, is a more indifficient and infallible rule of faith then is the holy Scriptures: That theſe and the like groſſe doctrines are beleeved and received, are great wonders.</p>

               <p>By fire in this place was fore-ſhewed the puniſhment which ſhould be inflicted on the Saints, which was burning with fire: And in that the fire was ſayd to come from heaven, thereby was foreſhewed, that the Iudges of the earth, <hi>Who are</hi>

                  <hi>called Gods,</hi> and their ſeats as the Throne of God in heauen, ſhould bee ſo corrupted by the Pope, as that they ſhould beleeue the Saints and Servants of God which refuſed to obey the Pope and his Lawes, to be therefore Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, refractarie, rebellious and diſobedient perſons, and therefore ſhould condemne them to be burnt to death: This they haue done, thinking they did God therein good ſervice, and that it was the iuſt iudgement of God upon them. Thus he made fire to come downe from heaven: For true it is, that the iudgements rightly pronounced by the lawfull Magiſtrates are the iudgements of God, and their puniſhments, Gods puniſhments, and therefore it is that Maigiſtrates are called Gods: but ſeeing Magiſtrates haue beene thus corrupted by the Pope, and made to pronounce unrighteous and unjuſt judgements, wee are to eſteeme them as the judgements of the Dragon; and yet nevertheleſſe their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power lawfull and ordained of God. Thus the Beaſt decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them that dwell on the earth, by meanes of thoſe Miracles (falſly ſo called) which he had power to doe in the ſight of the Beaſt, as is ſhewed in the verſe following.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Thoſe which the Beaſt deceiveth are ſayd to dwell on the earth, that is, haue their affections fet upon earthly things, and not upon heavenly, ſo that they will not for loue of the truth forſake their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſions and pleaſures: theſe are they which are deceived by theſe lying wonders of this Beaſt; but thoſe that are ſtrangers and pilgrimes in this world, whoſe affections are ſet upon heavenly things, and not upon earthly, theſe are not deceived nor deluded by him: theſe making tryall of him by Gods word haue found him to be a lyer and a deceiver, and beleeue him not, but taking their liues in their hands, witnes againſt

               <p>And whereas it is ſayd, that he had power to doe <hi>theſe miracles in the ſight of the Beaſt:</hi> therby is confirmed &amp; made manifeſt that which before is ſhewed page 23, that this ſonne of perdition, the chief darling of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catholick Mother, is preſent with her, and in her boſome, and for her ſake and in her behalf exerciſeth his power, ſhee retayning ſtill her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer authoritie without any diminiſhing thereof, as is evident unto all that are acquainted with the acts of that Church.

               <head>The 3. part of the 13.

               </head>
               <p>HEre we may ſee that the Pope by his commanding power, was the cauſe of ſetting up this Image, and for the better and more cleare underſtanding, what this Image is; Let us conſider a little the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne whoſe image and likenes it beareth, namely the firſt Beaſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt Beaſt, as hath beene ſhewed was the repreſentative body of the Catholicke Church Militant, conſiſting of the ſelected Prelacy and Preiſthood of ſundry Nations gathered together into one Councell, or Synode, with authoritie to make lawes and canons for the univerſall Church, to be obſerved uniformely of all Nations, under pretence of the inſufficiency of the Scripture for the government of the Church, and the worſhip of God. In like manner the Pope (in his wiſedome ſeeing it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the good government, maintenance, and upholding of his kingdome, and the rooting out of Heretickes, and ſeditious perſons (as they call them,) which daylie increaſed in every Countrie,) did ordeyne and command <note n="|" place="margin">

               <p>Further it is ſayd, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>And power was given him to giue life unto the Image of the Beaſt, that the Image of the Beaſt ſhould both ſpeake, and</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In this verſe wee may obſerue: firſt, that a gift was given to the Pope to beſtow upon this Image: ſecondly, what this gift was, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:3225:13"/> to giue life or breath to the Image: thirdly, the end and effects of the gift, which was, that the Beaſt ſhould ſpeake, and cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the Beaſt ſhould be killed: As there was given by the Dragon to the firſt Beaſt great power and authoritie, and alſo a mouth to ſpeake blaſphemies and to make warre with the Saints, in like manner by the ſame Dragon was this gift given to the Pope, to giue life or breathe to this Image: By life is here meant authoritie, which is the life of a Synode, without which it is of no force, and ſo this Image ſhould haue been no more then a very image or picture, and ſet up to no purpoſe, but the Pope having received it, gaue authority to the Image that he ſhould ſpeake, that is, make and ſet forth Canons and Lawes; for to ſpeake is ſo underſtood: as for example: A King is ſaid to ſpeake to his ſubiects when he ſetteth forth his Lawes and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: ſo this Beaſt having made Canons and Decrees, ſpeaketh to her vaſſals and ſubjects by them. Moreover, the Image cauſed that as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as would not worſhip him ſhould be killed: Here the pride and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of this Image is ſet forth, to be anſwerable to the firſt Beaſt, and therefore rightly is he called her Image: for as the firſt Beaſt made wart with the Saints and overcame them, and all that dwelled on the earth worſhiped him, &amp;c. ſo whoſoever would not worſhip this Image, that is, heare his voyce and keep his commandements, there was no way for him but death. All the worſhip that the Lord requireth of his ſervants, is * <hi>That they feare him, walke in all his wayes, loue him, and ſerue him with all their</hi>

                  <hi>hearts, and with all their ſoules to keep the commandements of the Lord, and his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</hi> And this is indeed the true worſhip of God, In like manner this Image wilbe worſhiped, his lawes muſt be obſerved &amp; his canons obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without examining and trying of them, be they never ſo unholy and unjuſt: They that do not obſerve and obey them, be they never ſo upright and holy men, they ſhalbe therefore indited, araigned, judged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, as being in their eſtimation Hereticks, Schiſmatickes, diſobedient and rebellious perſons, contemners of God and of the Church, yea as the filth and ofſcowring of the world, and unworthy of the ſocietie of men.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>This Image challenging worſhip to be performed unto him, of all people of all ſorts and degrees, according to the authoritie given him by the Pope, was by ſome contradicted and deſpiſed, wherfore the Image in policie for the better triall of thoſe that were his truſtie ſubjects and ſlaves, ordeyned: that all his Miniſters ſhould receive a marke, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving whereof, they ſhould vowe and ſweare to be of his dominion &amp; under his Banner, to fight againſt Chriſt and his Saincts. What this marke is, and what is the manner of giving and receiving of it, is now to be declared.</p>
               <p>The <note n="‡" place="margin">
                     <hi>For proofe of this looke no further then in the</hi> 36. <hi>Canon of the Church of Eng. made An.</hi> 1603.</note> Prelacye and Clergy being as hath been before ſhewed, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with authority to make lawes, did ordeyne that every Biſhop in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3225:13"/> his dioceſſe ſhould carefully obſerve that none ſhould preach or execute the function of a pariſh Parſon, Vicar or Curat in any pariſh, but he that would ſweare to obſerve their Lawes &amp; Canons, and thereupon ſhould receive the Letters of Orders of the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe, which Letters of Orders ſigned and ſealed by the Biſhop, is the Marke of the Beaſt here mentioned, and doth teſtify in the behalfe of the Bearer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that he is their ſworne ſervant, under holy orders, either a Prieſt, a Deacon, or half Preiſt &amp;c, and that he is a man found capable &amp; meete for the cure and charge of ſoules, and therfore to what pariſh ſoever theſe tryed Lads are ſent to doe ſervice, upon ſight of this Marke they muſt be received without any oppoſition, upon penaltie of the Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that ſhall refuſe them.</p>
               <p>Here may be objected, that this Marke is onely received by the Clergie, and not by the people of all ſorts, rich and poore, bond and free, according to the Text. I anſwer, that all perſons which receiue theſe falſe Prieſts doe likewiſe receiue, and ſubmit to that authority which ſent them, and alſo the Marke by which they are ſent, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, when a Prieſt commeth to take poſſeſſion of a Pariſh to which he is by the Biſhop appointed; he is not received upon his word, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he tolleth the Bell, and putteth on the Surplice, and uſeth other Ceremonies inioyned him by the Prelate: But, ſhewing the fore-ſaid Marke of the Beaſt they receiue both him and it, and communicate with him: Thus all, both ſmall and great, rich and poore, bond and free, that receiue and ſubmit unto their appointed Prieſt, receiue a marke in their foreheads, or in their right hands, by receiving and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to him: For as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith of his Apoſtles and Miniſters, <hi>He that receiveth you receiveth me, he that heareth you heareth me:</hi>

               <p>Whereas it is ſaid, that they received this marke in their <hi>foreheads, or right hand,</hi> thereby was ſhewed that this marke ſhould be an apparant teſtimony that they were ſervants of the Beaſt, and that they were of that Band which had ioyned hands, and made a league to walke in the wayes of deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Further it is ſaid, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>And that no man might buy or ſell ſaue he that had the marke of the Beaſt, or the name of the Beaſt, or the number of his name.</hi>

               <p>Here are propounded three conditions, and whoſoever had not one of them, thereby to be knowne to bee of that Kingdome, might not buy or ſell, or haue any thing to doe amongſt them. For the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding hereof let us minde, that although theſe three Beaſts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their ſeverall power and juriſdiction did differ one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, The Catholike Church being the chiefe, and the Pope inferiour to her, and the Image of the Beaſt as it were a ſervant or handmaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to them both, yet notwithſtanding they were one body, being ioyned and knit together by the power of the Dragon, and haue ſo farr

               <p>The third condition is the number of his name, as the Beaſt had one generall name (which the Catholick Church) whereby he was known from all other States and Kingdomes in the world, ſo it hath a number of names belonging to the particular parts and members thereof to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh one from another, as in the 17.

                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Beaſt, for it is the number of a man, and his number is</hi> 666.</p>
               <p>Here is ſhewed, firſt, what is required in ſearching out this myſterie, and that is wiſedom and underſtanding, not ſuch as is from beneath, but from aboue, which commeth down from the Father of lights, from whom commeth every good and perfect gift, hee it is that giveth wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the ſimple, and the underſtanding of his ſecrets to thoſe that feare him, which ſhould teach thoſe that deſire to know the Myſteries of his will to labour to be ſuch as to whom he hath promiſed to reveale them, then, whatſoever we aske we ſhall receiue of him, for to ſuch hee giveth liberally and upbraideth not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here is ſhewed a direction how to imploy a mans wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in finding out this Myſterie, and that is by counting or reckoning the number of this Beaſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a reaſon why the number of the Beaſt is to be counted, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the number of a man;</hi> that is, it agreeth with and is anſwerable to the parts of a man, and ſo is the more eaſily to be found: for as wee know the true Church of Chriſt is compared in the Scriptures to the naturall body of a man, as in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>For as the body is one and hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny members, and all the members of that one body being many are one body, ſo alſo is Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> And in the 27. verſe, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> hee ſaith: <hi>Yee are the body of Chriſt and members in particular, &amp;c.</hi> So in the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22. 23. <hi>Chriſt is given to be head ouer all things, to the Church which is his Body.</hi> Thus as the true Church is called and compared to a body; ſo the catholicks affirme that they onely are that church and that body, and that the particular parts and members of their church are the full number thereof. Now whereas they ſay they are the church, let us ſay they are the Beaſt; and whereas they ſay, their particular parts and members make up the number of the Church, let us ſay their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular parts and members make up the number of the Beaſt, and ſo we finde the true interpretation of this Scripture.</p>
               <p>Further, here is ſet downe the number of the Beaſt, which is 666. By this number I do not underſtand any ſet number, and that the parts and members of the Beaſt are no more nor leſſe, but thereby I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand is meant a full and compleate number, as before was ſhewed. As all the parts and members of a man ioyned together make a whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, ſo doe the particular parts and members of the Beaſt make a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3225:15"/> perfect and entire Beaſt. Thus briefly, according to the ability which God hath given me, I haue gone over this chapter, wherein is briefly ſet forth the workers of iniquitie which haue, and yet ſtill doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile over Gods people, under the title of Miniſters of the Goſpell and Church of Chriſt, as they were repreſented under the forme of three ſeverall Beaſts: The firſt Beaſt repreſenting the Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, or (as the Papiſts call it) the Catholick Church. The ſecond Beaſt repreſenting the Pope. And the third Beaſt the Provinciall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels which were eſtabliſhed by the Pope.</p>
               <p>The which three Beaſts bearing rule and dominion in theſe times whereinto wee are fallen, and being enemies and oppoſers of Chriſt and his Kingdome, it doth behooue us to know them, to end that wee may eſchew them and their evill wayes, and ſeek after the truth, making ſtraight ſteps unto the Kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>Now that we our ſelues may make particular uſe hereof, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for us to examine the Nationall Synode, or Convocation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſting of the Prelacy and clergie of this Land, who whilſt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained under the yoke and bondage of the church of Rome, and whilſt they exerciſed their power which was firſt given them by the Pope, for, and in the behalfe of that church and dominion, they were they very Image of the firſt Beaſt before mentioned: But being now ſeparated from the Pope, and Church of Rome, they thinke (as it ſhould ſeeme) that their ſpirituall Pontificall power and authority which they exerciſe is lawfull and warrantable, and to bee ſubmitted unto: They being gathered together boaſt themſelues to bee the repreſentatiue body of the Church of England, and the true Church of Chriſt, and that they haue power to make Lawes and Canons for governement thereof, and for the worſhip of God, which all men ought to yeeld obedience unto, as appeareth by divers of their books of Canons.</p>
               <p>But wee are not to take this upon their word, but to make triall thereof by the word of God, whether it be true or falſe. If the word of God did giue them ſuch power and authority, then indeed wee were bound in conſcience to yeeld all ready obedience to their Lawes and Canons: But the moſt wiſe God and diſpoſer of all things, who knoweth the vanity of mens mindes, would not haue his people to hold their faith in reſpect of mens perſons, and at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to alter and change the ſame, and therefore did not giue to any of his Miniſters power to make Lawes in matters of Religion and for the worſhip of God, but gaue them power onely to teach the Nations to obſerue the things which hee had commanded them, as in the eight and twentieth chapter of Mathew, the nineteenth &amp; twentieth verſes. And the Apoſtle Paul biddeth the Corinthians, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>to bee followers of him as hee followed Chriſt:</hi> And in the ſame Chapter hee alſo ſaith, <hi>That which hee had received of the Lord, hee delivered unto them.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</note>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:3225:16"/> Alſo the Aſſembly of the Apoſtles and Elders of the Church of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, they would not impoſe any yoke of bondage upon the Churches of Chriſt, but held it to be a tempting of God ſo to doe, as before hath been ſhewed: And this agreeth with that in <hi>Deutr.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Whatſoever I command you take heed you doe it; Thou ſhalt put nothing thereto, nor take ought therefrom:</hi> By which Scriptures it is plaine, that the chiefeſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpell had no ſuch power as theſe Prelates preſume to haue, as we ſhall finde by examining their particular Canons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, of which, for examples, I will onely note ſome few of their late and beſt reformed Book, made <hi>An.</hi> 1603. in the firſt yeere of the Kings Maieſties raigne, by which it will be apparant that they paſſe the bounds of the ſubjects of Chriſt, and that they haue no power from him to make ſuch lawes; but by ſo doing they uſurp the place of God to reigne in mens conſciences, for unto him onely it doth belong to make Lawes in matters of Religion and for the worſhip of God, to which, men are onely bound to yeeld obedience, without adding, or detracting, and that for this their preſumption they are liable to the curſe of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed the Image of the Beaſt here ſpoken of, that is originally ſprung from the Dragon, and hath received power of Law-making from him. Concerning the firſt and ſecond Canons wherein they pretend their zeale for the aboliſhing of all forrein power repugnant to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Kings Majeſtie over the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate, he being the higheſt power under God to whom all men owe moſt loyall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and that his Maieſty hath the like authority in Cauſes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call as the godly Kings had amongſt the Iewes. To theſe I do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly aſſent and agree: And further doe deſire, that (as the Pope) ſo the Prelacie with all their Antichriſtian Adherents which uſurp ſpirituall power and ſuperiority, aboue the Maieſty of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, being a ſtrange and forraine generation, brought in and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Land by the Pope of Rome, may alſo bee aboliſhed and caſt out after him: for by them the Pope liues in hope hereafter to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as he hath been heretofore, to the great vexation of the Kings and Princes of this Land, yea to the loſſe of their Crowne and liues.</p>
               <p>But to be ſhort, I will proceed to mention ſome few of their canons, whereby iniquity is eſtabliſhed for a Law, and their beaſtlineſſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. In the third canon it is enacted, that whoſoever ſhall affirme the Church of England, by Law eſtabliſhed, not to be a true and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Church, teaching and maintaining the doctrine of the Apoſtles, that perſon ſhall be excommunicated, <hi>ipſo facto.</hi> That there are ſome, yea many doctrines of the Apoſtles maintained in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I do not deny, ſo there are in the Church of Rome: But that the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, or ſpirituall body politick, which is called the Church of England, which conſiſteth of Arch biſhops, Dioceſan Lord Biſhops, Suffragans, Deanes, Arch-deacons, Prehends, Canons, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, Commiſſaries, with the reſt of the Clergie, as heads and guides of that body to go before, and the whole multitude of the Layitie (as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3225:16"/> they call it) which is as the Tayle to follow thoſe Heads, that this politicall Body is the Spouſe and church of Chriſt, as they affirme in their ſeuenth, eigth, and ninth canons, that I do deny: For firſt, if it were true, that they are the Miniſters of Chriſt and members of the Body of Chriſt which is his Church, we ſhould finde warrant for them in his Teſtament, wherein is ſet downe the Miniſters which hee hath ſet in the Church; namely, Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11.</note> Teachers, and alſo their office and adminiſtration: But in all the new Teſtament, no Arch-biſhops nor Lord-biſhops, no Deanes nor Arch-deacons, Prebends, Prieſts nor canons, no chancellors nor commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and other their court officers, nor any ſuch adminiſtration as they challenge and execute, can there be found, they are a ſtrange genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is riſen up out of the earth, for earthly-minded and vaine men haue invented them, and therefore the body which conſiſteth of them cannot of right be acknowledged to be the Body of Chriſt, whoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in reſpect that they are called according to the commandement of Chriſt, are from heaven: But it is indeed the Image of the firſt Beaſt, whoſe mouth was as the mouth of a Lyon, his body like a Leopard, and his feete as the feete of a Beare, an ougly compounded and deformed monſter. And as their names are ſtrange, and different from the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Chriſt, ſo is their practiſe contrary: they are not ſervants to the Flock and Church of Chriſt, and helpers of their ioy, but they are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of their woe, challenging and exerciſing Lordſhip and dominion over their faith; for in ſtead of a due adminiſtration of the word of God, they haue mingled a cup of fornication for the people to drinke, that is, deviſed a forme of booke-worſhip, with orders, rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which they haue impoſed on the people under the title of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, and which they muſt obſerue without adding thereto, or taking any thing from it, as in the 4. 6. 7. 8. and 14. canons.</p>
               <p>Further they are not painefull preachers, but lazy Lords, they are not followers of Chriſt and of his word, but are contemners thereof, caſting it behind their backs, and will not be reformed, nor ruled by it, they are Lawmakers much like <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> for as he would deſtroy all that would not worſhip his golden Image; So whoſoever doth refuſe to yeild obedience to their Lawes, ſhalbe moſt ſeverely puniſhed, as is playne by diverſe penalties annexed unto their Cannons.</p>
               <p>In conſecrating and ordeyning Preiſts, they are like to Ieroboam, for as he conſecrated whome he would of the baſeſt of the people, to be the Preiſts of the high places which he had ſet up; ſo doe they ordeyne for the moſt part ignorant fellowes to be their pariſh prieſts and inferior Miniſters: wherein though they doe moſt abſurdly, yet will they not be contradicted, as we may ſee by the 57. Canon, where it is ſayd <hi>whoſoever ſhall refuſe to comunicate with a dumbe and unpreaching Miniſter, Let him be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.</hi> And although their owne Doctors complayne and cry out againſt it, yet they will not amend: amongſt the reſt it is worthy to be obſerved what their owne great Champion profound Mr. Hooper ſayth,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3225:17"/> viz. That <hi>both Arguments from light of nature, Lawes and Statutes of ſcripture, the Canons that are taken out of auncyent Synodes, the decrees and conſtitutions of ſincereſt tymes, the ſentences of all antiquitte, and in a word every mans conſent and conſcience, is againſt ignorance in them that have the cure and charge of ſoules.</hi> If it be ſo, how unreaſonable and beaſtly is it for the Prelats to ordeyne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe and approve of ſuch for the Miniſters of Chriſt, of which there are many hundreds in the land, whome the Prelats are not aſhamed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to expound the Scriptures, as in the 49. Canon, where it is ſayd, that ſome of their pariſh prieſts <hi>ſhall not take upon them to expound in their cure or elſwhere, any Scripture, or matter, or doctrine, but ſhall onely ſtudy to reade &amp;c.</hi> It is greatly to be wondered at, that ſo many grave heads as were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together and ſate conſulting about theſe matters, ſhould breed and bring forth ſuch abſurd and impious Canons. If there were nothing elſe, this allowance of dumbe Miniſters, is ſufficient to ſhew the vanitie of their mindes and the darkneſſe of their fooliſh hearts: So that we may truely ſay of them, that when they profeſſed themſelves to be moſt wiſe, by exalting and making themſelves equall with God, in making lawes for the government of his houſe the Church, even then they became moſt fooliſh and void of judgment.</p>
               <p>As for the beſt ſort of their pariſh Preiſts which are men of learing and gifts, they muſt alſo be confined within their limitts, they muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God according to the rules preſcribed them by theſe their ſpirituall Fathers, as in the 38. Canon. <hi>If any miniſter ſhall omitt to uſe the forme of Prayer, or any of the orders or Ceremonies preſcribed in the Communion Booke, let him be ſuſpended, and if he doe not conforme within the ſpace of a moueth, let him be depoſed.</hi> The abſurdities and blaſphemies conteyned in that Comon prayer Booke are many, which having been diſcovered and layd open by divers treatiſes already publiſhed in print, I will omit, onely this I will add, that in the impoſing of that ſervice Booke, or any other, this great iniquitie is committed by the impoſers therof; That they doe exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves both againſt Chriſt, who is aſcended into heaven <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8. 11. 12.</note> and hath given gifts to his Miniſters, for the gathering together of the Saincts, <hi>for the worke of the miniſtery, and for the edification of the Church his body,</hi> and alſo they exalt themſelves againſt the holy Ghoſt, who onely hath power <note n="‡" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.</note> to <hi>helpe our infirmities,</hi> &amp; to furniſh men with gifts to worſhip God aright. Further their preachers may not teach againſt their corrupt Church ſtate and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie, though they know it to be Antichriſtian, nor againſt the forme of worſhip preſcribed in the ſaid comon prayer Booke, nor againſt the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, nor the government of the church of England by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deanes, Archdeacons, and the reſt that beare office in the ſame, nor againſt the manner and forme of making and conſecrating Biſhops Preiſts or Deacons, nor againſt the Lawes and Ordinances <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed in the ſayd Church, whoſoever tranſgreſſeth in theſe things, ſhalbe excommunicated <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> as is playne in the 4. 6. 7. 8. &amp; 54. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. Thus by excommunicating and curſing they labour to mainteine and defend their corruptions, but not one iote of Scripture dare they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3225:17"/> ſhew, and no marvell; ſeeing the whole ſcriptures are againſt mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and traditions, of which nature theſe abuſes are, being left here by the Pope, and reteyned and renewed by his Prelates. As they may not teach againſt theſe things, ſo on the contrarie, they may not teach the true and right way which Chriſt hath preſcribed in his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how we muſt worſhip God, nor how the true Church of Chriſt ought to be gathered and conſtituted, the Miniſters thereof ordained, nor the manner how it ought to bee governed, as appeareth in the 9. 10. 11. and 12. Canons. By which we may ſee in what bondage their Preachers are kept, they muſt hide their Talent in the earth, and put their candle under a Buſhell, leſt men by the light thereof ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth and beleeue it. Alſo it is to be obſerved as a generall rule, that none, good or bad, learned or unlearned, can be ſuffered to receiue their Orders of Prieſthood or Deaconſhip, or be admitted to preach, or execute a Miniſterie in their Pariſh Churches, unleſſe they ſweare to conforme to the worſhip and ceremonies preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by theſe Prelates, and alſo ſubmit to their Antichriſtian rule and governement, which they challenge to themſelues, as being Lords over all: Thus by ſwearing they make their inferiour Prieſts to ſell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to work wickedneſſe; which trick they haue cunningly deviſed to bring the Land in ſubjection to their Antichriſtian yoke: And upon the taking of this Oath they receiue the Prelates Marke, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this Chapter, <hi>the Marke of the Beaſt;</hi> which is underſtood to be the Letters of Orders under the Prelates hand and ſeale to teſtifie that they are made Prieſts or Deacons, according to the order and canons preſcribed in that behalfe, in this their Convocation, as wee may ſee in the 36. 48. and 50. Canons: And for refuſing to worſhip them in theſe things, many are put back, and thoſe that formerly haue been ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for refuſing ſo to doe (which they call revolting) haue had their penall Lawes executed upon them, which is Suſpenſion, Degradation, and Excommunication, and after theſe many other afflictions in body, goods and name; being accounted factious and ſeditious perſons, that haue no right to buy or ſell their wares.</p>
               <p>Concerning the people whereof the Church of England conſiſteth, it is neceſſary that wee finde them ſuch as the Scriptures doe require, otherwiſe they cannot be accounted the Church of Chriſt, and to this end obſerue theſe few places following, <hi>Ezeckiel</hi> 44. 19. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, no ſtranger uncircumciſed in heart and uncircumciſed in fleſh ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Sanctuarie:</hi> And the people of Iſrael for ſuffering ſuch uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed ſtrangers to enter into the Sanctuary of the Lord, hee calleth them <hi>a rebellious people, that had polluted his Sanctuarie, and broken his Covenant;</hi> And in the 23. verſe, The Lord teacheth his Miniſters to put difference betweene the holy and prophane, the cleane and uncleane; And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this was the practiſe of the Apoſtles in the primitiue Age, who by preaching the Word gathered none but ſuch as beleeved, and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily ſubmitted themſelues to walke according to the profeſſion of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3225:18"/> Goſpell; and if any did cunningly creepe into the fellowſhip of the Saints, and not walk accordingly, they were to bee caſt out by the Church, as in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Likewiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hee ſeparated the Diſciples of Epheſus from thoſe that beleeved not; ſo the Apoſtle <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 9.</note> taught the Corinthians, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. 15. <hi>&amp;c. Bee not unequally yoked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with unbeleevers, for what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? And what communion hath light with darkneſſe? And what concord hath Chriſt with Belial? Or what part hath hee that beleeveth with an Infidell? And what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? For yee are the Temple of the living God, as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them and walke in them, and I will be their God and they ſhall be my people; Wherefore come out from amongſt them, and bee yee ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the uncleane thing, and I will receiue you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if we compare the Church of England with theſe Scriptures we ſhall finde that the practiſe and proceedings thereof, hath been, and is contrary. The people thereof (for the moſt part) are ſuch as viſibly and apparantly liue in all kinde of licentiouſneſſe, and in their workes deny God, being abominable and diſobedient. For theſe Lordly Prelates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed with the ſword of Civill authority, and having the Law of their ſide, they haue not laboured by painefull preaching to draw men to the obedience of the faith, and to the fellowſhip of the Goſpell apart from the prophane and wicked, that ſpeake evill of the wayes of the Lord, but they haue compelled and inforced all ſorts of people, both religious and prophane, not onely ſuch as feare God, but alſo ſuch as feare him not, by bodily puniſhments to be conformable to the profeſſion which is by their Canon Law eſtabliſhed in this Church: As if the Word of God, that ſword of the Spirit were not mighty enough in operation for the gathering together of the Saints. That this is their practiſe is plaine by the 90. and 114. Canons, where it is ſaid, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Church-wardens muſt preſent all perſons aboue the age of 13. yeeres, that come not to the Church and receiue the Sacraments; after which preſentation, if they doe not conforme they ſhall bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, impriſoned, and haue their goods attached: This is the meanes which hath been uſed for the gathering of this Church of England, whereby they haue confounded and mingled them together whom God hath commanded to be ſeparated: wherein what do they leſſe then thinke themſelues wiſer and ſtronger then God? The Word of God is the ſeed whereby the Church of God is begotten, and thoſe that are begotten by any other meanes are baſtards, and not ſonnes: for as that woman is an Harlot which hath children by any but her law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Husband: ſo that Church whoſe members are gathered by any other way or meanes, then by the Word of God, perſwading and mouing their hearts, the ſame is not the Church of Chriſt: But this hath been the manner of gathering the Church of England, and therefore it is unworthy to be adorned with the title of the Church of Chriſt, but ought to be accounted the Image of the firſt Beaſt before ſpoken of,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3225:18"/> that is, of <hi>great Babylon which is an habitation of divells, an hold of ſowle ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and a cage of every uncleane and hatefull Bird.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for confirmation hereof by the teſtimonie of their own mouthes, let us but conſider the eſtimation which the members of this Church haue one of another: Some there are amongſt them, who for making more conſcience of their waies then the reſt, are in deriſion called <hi>Puritans</hi> or <hi>Preciſians;</hi> theſe on the contrary ſeeing the ungodly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the reſt of their brethren, eſteeme them as wicked, prophane, carnall and unregenerate men, ſuch as (for the moſt part) are mockers, contemners, and evill ſpeakers of the Truth, and in whom is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Religion and the feare of God; and therefore they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the better ſort from theſe prophane perſons by the name of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</hi> This is the eſtimation which they haue one of another, which is a manifeſt note that they are not come into the order of the Church of Chriſt. I deny not but there are many amongſt them, that are the Saints and Servants of Chriſt, that are godly and zealous people, which ſo farre as they know, they labour to yeeld obedience to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of Chriſt; and although by meanes of their Guides which make them to erre and goe aſtray, keeping them in ignorance of this doctrine, yet it ſhall go well with them: Such perſons (I ſay) are fit ſtones for the building of the Church of Chriſt, but ſo long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in this confuſion, they can no more bee ſaid to be the true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church of Chriſt, then a heape of ſtones fitted for a building can bee ſaid to be a houſe; therefore they muſt be ſeparated from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and placed together according to the order preſcribed by Chriſt Ieſus, and practiſed by his Apoſtles, as in the new Teſtament, before they can be ſo eſteemed.</p>
               <p>As theſe Prelates will haue this Church of England to be accounted the true Church of Chriſt, ſo they will haue the true Church of Chriſt to be accounted falſe, ſchiſmaticall and hereticall, as in the 9. 10. and 11. Canons: by which it doth appeare, that if any people ſeparate from this corrupt Church ſtate, and ioyne together apart from the wicked and prophane, to walke in all the wayes and ordinances of Chriſt preſcribed in his Teſtament, acknowledging Chriſt Ieſus to be the onely King, Lord, and Law-giver in matters of Religion and the worſhip of God, which is the true and right rule whereby Gods people ought to walke, and by ſo doing they become indeed the true Church of Chriſt, to whom hee hath promiſed his preſence and bleſſing: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch perſons are for this to be accounted Schiſmaticks, and to be excommunicated <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> as holding wicked errours. Thus they open their mouthes wide to ſpeake evill of the waies of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo they appeare to be the very Image of the Beaſt that blaſphemed the Tabernacle of God, as is ſhewed before upon the ſixth verſe.</p>
               <p>Further, whereas the Apoſtles did ordaine divers Elders in every Church, to whom they gaue charge to feede the Flock of Chriſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Holy Ghoſt had made them Overſeers: On the contrary theſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3225:19"/> Prelates in ſtead of Elders to feed one Flock, they do ordaine one idle Prieſt to be fed of divers Flocks; that is, ſome to haue two, ſome three, and ſome foure Benefices, and this they are not aſhamed to publiſh, as appeareth in the 41. Canon, by which it is allowed, that Licences and Diſpenſations ſhall be granted to Maſters of Arts, and other Graduates, to haue pluralitie of Benefices, ſo that they be within the compaſſe of 30. miles.</p>
               <p>Concerning their Copes, Surplices, Croſſing in Baptiſme, and other their fooliſh ceremonies, which they themſelues acknowledge to bee things indifferent, yet thoſe that refuſe to uſe them through the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of their conſciences are therefore greatly afflicted and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, ſo farre are they unlike the Apoſtle (who would not uſe <note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13.</note> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie things that were offenſiue to his brethren) as that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues will, not onely uſe thoſe things which are unneceſſarie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in their uſe, iuſtly ſcandalous and offenſiue; yea, and compell their brethren alſo to uſe them, which if they refuſe, they ſhall enjoy nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liberty, nor worldly poſſeſſions. How unworthy this their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe is for thoſe that would bee accounted Chriſtians, let the world iudge: certainely, it is ſo contrary to Chriſtian Charitie, as that it is to be accounted Heatheniſh impiety, and beaſtly cruelty, and it is as a Marke in their foreheads to teſtifie unto the world that they are thoſe which our Saviour Chriſt ſpeaketh of, that <hi>ſhould come in ſheepes cloathing</hi> (that is, pretending themſelues to bee the Miniſters of the Goſpell, and ſuch as deſire peace and unity) <hi>but inwardly are rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Wolues:</hi> ſuch as do ſow ſtrife and contention, and by this meanes they grow rich, filling themſelues with the ſpoyle of their brethren, whom they perſecute, as Lyons, Beares and Leopards fill themſelues with their prey.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and many other evils by their Canon Law eſtabliſhed, and to the diſhonour of God and vexation of his people daily practiſed, haue been much oppoſed, and the iniquity of them ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, but as yet it remaineth like unto the Decrees of the Medes and Perſians, that may not bee changed: yea, they boaſt and ſay (like their old Mother) that without their Lawes the Church of Chriſt would run into confuſion, as if the Teſtament and Lawes of Chriſt were not ſufficient for the governement of his Church and Kingdome. Thus they open their mouthes and reproach the Almightie: But <hi>hee who ſitteth in the heavens laugheth them to ſcorne, and will vexe them in his ſore diſpleaſure,</hi> if they repent not.</p>
               <p>By theſe few examples of their wicked practiſes, I haue briefly ſhewed that this Church of England ſtill remaineth under the bondage of Antichriſt, and is ruled and governed by the Image of the Beaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this 13. chapter, which uſurpeth that power which is onely proper to Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is objected in the behalf of the Church of England, that it is fallen and ſeparated from Babylon, the univerſall Church of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3225:19"/> Rome, and therfore it is the true Church of Chriſt, and needs no other ſeparation. To this I anſwere, that true it is that that great Citie is now divided into three parts, as was foreſhewed in the 16. chapter of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, and the cities of the Nations (that is the Nationall churches, wherof the church of England is one,) are fallen from it; but this is no argument that therfore they are the true churches of Chriſt that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from Rome, unleſſe they be united and joyned to Chriſt, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and built together according to the patterne preſcribed in his Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. It is indeed an argument that their kingdome ſhall not long ſtand, as our Saviour Chriſt teacheth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. <hi>Every kingdome divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf, is brought to deſolation: and every Citie or Houſe divided againſt it ſelf ſhall not ſtand. And if Satan caſt out Satan, he is divided againſt himſelfe: how ſhall then his kingdome ſtand?</hi> Thus by the diviſion of this great Citie, Gods people may receive comfort and rejoyce in aſſured hope, that the fall and deſtruction of Babylon is neere, and that the Lord will ſhortly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of their iniquities, which ſhould teach us to <hi>come out from amongſt them, that we partake not of their ſynns, and ſo receive of their plagues, and to have no fellowſhip with their unfruitfull workes of darkneſſe, but rather reproove them, and ſtedfaſtly reſiſt and fight againſt them. So ſhall we receive the crowne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which God the righteous Judge ſhall give at his appearing. To whome be glory and Dominion for ever &amp; ever Amen.</hi>
